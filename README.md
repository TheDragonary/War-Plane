# War Plane
Very simple 2D scrolling fighter plane game using Pygame

Shoot down enemy planes and try for a high score, but the game gets faster with every 10 points you get

>This game was part of a school project so don't expect me to continue development on this. I'm not going to add anything new or fix anything. However, if you would like to contribute (I doubt anyone would), please make a pull request with the modified code. I would appreciate it if someone knows how to fix the bugs listed in [Known Bugs](https://github.com/TheDragonary/War-Plane/#known-bugs).

And yes, there are two python files in the repo, that is no mistake.

`main.py` = The main game itself of course

`no_menu.py` = Just the game without any of the menus

## Building
Not sure why you would ever want to build this as you can find the latest build in [Releases](https://github.com/TheDragonary/War-Plane/releases) but anyways,

Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/TheDragonary/War-Plane
```

Run the setup file
```
python setup.py build
```

Give it a few seconds and you'll find yourself with a new exe file!
